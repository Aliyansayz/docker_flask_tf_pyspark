Using dockers to build a python flask app pipeline that ingests data in stream / batch using pyspark and then tensorflow for normalization and training and then validation results.  

To build a Python Flask app pipeline that ingests data in stream/batch using PySpark, and then TensorFlow for normalization, training, and validation, you can use Docker to create a containerized solution that can be deployed on any platform. Here's a step-by-step guide to building this pipeline:

1. Design the architecture: Define the pipeline architecture and the different components required for ingestion, preprocessing, training, and validation. For example, you might have one component responsible for ingesting data from a stream/batch, another component for preprocessing the data using PySpark, and a third component for training and validating the machine learning model using TensorFlow.

2. Set up the development environment: Install the necessary software and dependencies for Flask, PySpark, and TensorFlow on your development machine. This might include Python, Java, and any other required libraries.

3. Write the Flask application: Use Flask to create the web application that will serve as the interface for the pipeline. This might include defining the API endpoints, creating routes, and handling requests and responses.

4. Write the PySpark code: Use PySpark to perform data preprocessing and cleaning as required for your machine learning model. This might include reading data from streams/batches, transforming the data, and preparing it for use with TensorFlow.

5. Write the TensorFlow code: Use TensorFlow to train your machine learning model, and to validate the predictions on new data. This might include defining the model architecture, preparing the data for training, and evaluating the model's performance.

6. Containerize the pipeline with Docker: Use Docker to package each component of the pipeline into a container that includes all its dependencies. This makes it easy to deploy and run the pipeline on any machine or platform.

7. Deploy the pipeline to a cloud provider: Use a cloud provider such as AWS or Google Cloud Platform to deploy the pipeline to a scalable, reliable environment. This might include setting up a Kubernetes cluster to manage the containers, configuring load balancing and auto-scaling, and monitoring the performance and availability of the pipeline.

8. Test and optimize the pipeline: Use automated testing and monitoring tools to ensure that the pipeline is functioning correctly and efficiently. This might include load testing to simulate high data volumes, optimizing the code and configurations for better performance, and continuously monitoring the pipeline for errors or issues.

Overall, building a Python Flask app pipeline that ingests data in stream/batch using PySpark and TensorFlow requires careful planning, design, and implementation. By following these steps, you can create a scalable, reliable, and efficient pipeline that can handle complex data processing and machine learning tasks.
